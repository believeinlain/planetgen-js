# Types of boundaries
- Convergent
  - One side will be subduction, leading to an ocean trench, the other will rise and form a mountain range
  - The subduction zone will increase the speed of tectonic movement for its respective plate
- Divergent
  - Leads to a rift, often creating a sea or sunken landmass between the plates
- Transform
  - Leads to a disparity in elevation at the plate junction. Plate elevation will not change gradually at a transform junction

# Effects of motion
- Tidal forces are the main determining factor for direction of plate movement
- Planet rotation seems to have only a small effect
- For the most part, initial direction of plate motion seems to be arbitrary

# Procedure
- Assign a direction of motion to each plate (at first this may be completely random)
- Identify what type each boundary is and display that (arrows)
